## How to Run Locally

To get a local copy of this project up and running on your machine, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

* A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
* Git (for cloning the repository).

### Setup and Running

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/Amirun-Nahar/DevBoard.git](https://github.com/Amirun-Nahar/DevBoard.git)
    ```
    *(If your project is located in `Assignment-5-DevBoard-`, then use that repo link instead and navigate into the `DevBoard` folder if it's a sub-directory).*

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd DevBoard
    ```

3.  **Open the `index.html` file:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You can usually do this by double-clicking the file in your file explorer, or by dragging it into a browser tab.
    * Alternatively, if you have a local development server (like Live Server extension in VS Code or `http-server` via npm), you can start it from this directory:
        ```bash
        # If you have http-server installed globally:
        http-server
        ```
        Then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by the server).
